    "# Road Following - Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "If your motors and camera are working then you can start this activtiy.  This is where we get into the AI!  We are going to train an AI model to drive the car along a road!  This AI model is called an artifical neural network (ANN), because it tries to mimic the behaviour of the human brain (which is a real neural network!).  The technique for training the ANN is called deep learning.  It's a really important (and complex!) technique in AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Approach\n",
    "The general approach is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Data Collection**\n",
    "1. Get the car to take a picture of the road ahead.\n",
    "2. Tell the car which direction to go if it sees this road situation.\n",
    "3. Go back to step 1 until you have enough images\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Train the Model**\n",
    "1. Present the images to the deep learning neural network\n",
    "2. The neural network will 'learn' what to do when it sees not just the road situations you have given it, but *any* road situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Optimise the Model**\n",
    "1. Optimise the model so it works well on the Jetbot\n",
    "\n",
    "**d. Drive!**\n",
    "1. Test your robot on the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers step a - the data collection.\n",

    "This is what we will do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Place the JetBot in different positions on the road (offset from center, different angles, etc)\n",
    "2. Display the live camera feed from the robot\n",
    "3. Click on the image to place a 'green dot', which corresponds to the target direction we want the robot to travel, on the image.\n",
    "4. Store the X, Y values of this green dot along with the image from the robot's camera\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you decide exactly where to place the target for this example?  Here is a guide we think may help\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Look at the live video feed from the camera\n",
    "2.  Imagine the path that the robot should follow (try to approximate the distance it needs to avoid running off road etc.)\n",
    "3.  Place the target as far along this path as it can go so that the robot could head straight to the target without 'running off' the road.\n"
